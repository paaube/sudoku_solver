# Sudoku Solver

The goal of this project is to quickly solve any sudoku grid provided in .txt format. To do so, the program uses a backtracking algorithm with a recursive function.

## How to use:

### In sudoku_solver.py you can change the value of filename to assign it to any grid stored in txt format

<br>
The Python script takes a .txt file as the input containing a sudoku grid where empty squares are 0 and every line contains all the numbers for this line in the sudoku grid.
