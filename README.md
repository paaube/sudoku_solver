# Sudoku Solver

The goal of this project is to quickly solve any sudoku grid provided in .txt format. To do so, the program uses a backtracking algorithm and a recursive function.

## How to use:

The Python script takes a .txt file as the input containing a sudoku grid where empty squares are 0 and every line contains all the numbers for this line in the sudoku grid.
